# Social networking site

One of my very first amateur projects - social networking site made in C++ as console application.
It contains many classes that interact with each other. Activities that can be made:
  - add new user
  - rename random user
  - friend requests and follow queries
  - post creation and sharing
  - random commenting on posts
  - user group creation and joining into them
  - sending messages to other users
  - launch simulation where all activities above occur and are commented in the output
